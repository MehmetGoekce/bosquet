;; Question: \{{Q}}
;; Answer: {% gen var-name=answer model=gpt-4 temperature=0.2 %}

;; ```edn
;; {:q1   ["Q: When I was {{age}} my sister was half my age."
;;         "Now Iâ€™m 70 how old is my sister? A: {{a}}"]
;;  :a    {:llm/service :ollama :llm/model-params {:model :llama2})}
;; ```

;;  :gen :DEFAULT-LLM}
;; ```
;; The initial solution was based on Integrant but that was too cumbersome and hard to extend.
;; The defaults are defined like this: `env.edn`
